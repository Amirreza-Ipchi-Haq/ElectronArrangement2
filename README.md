# ElectronArrangement2
This is a new version of the previous [ElectronArrangement](https://github.com/Amirreza-Ipchi-Haq/ElectronArrangement) program. It's now based on Aufbau's `n+l` chemical order, so it now shows the sub-layers too. if you don't understand what is a sub-layer in an atom, then you can use the previous program.
